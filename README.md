# African Character Prompting

**Prompt strategies for generating realistic, modern, and diverse African characters in AI image and text models.**

This repository includes two fully worked example characters — one male and one female — used as **reference mascots** to demonstrate what well-constructed, realistic prompts look like in practice.

Each example includes:
- A complete prompt
- The reasoning behind the prompt structure
- A copy-paste–ready block you can use directly in an image generator

The goal is to show, concretely, how proper prompting produces believable modern African characters.

## What this repository is

This repository is a **practical prompt library** for improving how AI models generate African and African-descended characters.

It focuses on **realism**, **modern context**, and **accurate physical representation**, particularly in image generation tools such as:

- ChatGPT image generation  
- Leonardo AI  
- Z-Image  
- Stable Diffusion based systems  

This is not a political project.  
It is a **technical response to predictable model failures**.

## The problem this repository addresses

Many current AI models consistently misrepresent African characters in a small number of repeatable ways:

- Over-defaulting to rural, tribal, or impoverished imagery  
- Distorting body proportions and physical structure  
- Collapsing diverse African populations into a single generic appearance  
- Applying European fashion-model anatomy as a default  
- Swinging between underrepresentation and caricature  

These issues are not usually intentional.  
They are the result of uneven training data and weak default assumptions.

## What this repository is not

To avoid confusion, this project is **not**:

- A claim that all Africans look the same  
- A denial of physical or structural differences between populations  
- A moral or ideological critique of AI companies  
- A collection of artistic styles or fantasy aesthetics  

This repository is about **correcting technical failure modes** using better prompts.

## Core approach

This library works by:

1. Over-specifying context  
   (urban vs rural, modern vs historical, lifestyle and environment)

2. Encoding physical realism explicitly  
   (structure, proportion, posture, and presence)

3. Actively excluding common default biases  
   (poverty cues, documentary aesthetics, caricature)

The goal is not exaggeration.  
The goal is believable, contemporary representation.

## Example characters (reference mascots)

The following two characters are used throughout this repository as **grounded reference examples** of modern African representation.

They are not archetypes.  
They are **practical test cases**.

## Example 1: Adewale (Yoruba male)

Adewale represents a modern West African male in a contemporary, urban context.
